# public-followprice

The syno.py script allows to capture the prize of some product (Synology DS920 / DS923 / DS1621 and a lamp for Benq W1720 Beamer, as well as a technical canvas for home teater) on the websiteÂ www.digitec.ch

The syno_price.ipynb allows to read the data of the different csv files, in order to obtain a chart of the evolution of the prize.
